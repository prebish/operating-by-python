## Overview

Welcome! This repository is a collection of simple Python projects represented in Jupyter Notebooks which are designed to demonstrate lower-level OS concepts typically found in C. By using Python + Jupyter Notebooks, we can provide a higher-level interactive perspective on Operating System concepts, making them more accessible and easier to understand. Explore and learn some Operating System concepts with practical, hands-on examples.

## Getting Started

Its simple, really. Each folder represents a topic in OS. Within each folder, there is a Jupyter Notebook which acts as an interactive demo to help you visualize and trace how things work.

To install the necessary dependencies for the demonstrations, navigate to its directory and run the appropriate command for your operating system:

- **Windows**: `pip install jupyter` or `python -m pip install jupyter`
- **MacOS/Linux**: `pip3 install jupyter`

### Repository Contents

Within this repository, you'll find individual folders for each demo. Every folder contains:

- A `*.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) file

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that combine executable code, rich text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis, scientific research, and educational purposes. They can be viewed and edited using the Jupyter Notebook application, which is part of the Jupyter Project. You can access and run Jupyter Notebooks by installing Jupyter via pip (see the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section) and launching it with the jupyter notebook command from your terminal or command prompt.

### Jupyter Notebook in VS Code

While you can access and run Jupyter Notebooks by installing Jupyter and launch it with the command line, you can also view them in Visual Studio Code. To download and use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code, install the Jupyter extension from the Extensions Marketplace.

## Conclusion

Whether you're taking your first steps in programming or seeking to master advanced concepts, the Operating-by-Python repository offers a pathway to enhance your coding skills and deepen your understanding of Operating Systems.
